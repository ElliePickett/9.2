The thicker blade allows you to easily cut through the soft breastbone of a bird without having to worry too much about chipping. Normally Moritaka knives rust a bit easily, but I’ve found that rusting isn’t as big a deal on a carbon steel knife primarily used for butchery, as long as you you do a good job of washing and drying your blade when you are finished as you would when using a knife on any kind of raw meat.<\/p>","review":true,"fun-fact-heading":"Fun Fact","fun-fact":"<p><em>This exact knife is recommended in the yakitori bible,<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/ca.phaidon.com\/store\/food-cook\/chicken-and-charcoal-9780714876450\/\">Chicken & Charcoal<em> by Matt Abergel<\/em><\/a><em>.

This is one of several lines we carry that uses both carbon and stainless steel in the blade; the hard carbon makes a sharp edge and jacket of stainless really cuts down the chance of rust forming. Rust on a knife can be a huge bummer. This line is very popular among professional cooks and chefs because they look so cool, hold an awesome edge, and are a lot easier to care for than a straight-up carbon knife.

(There’s a good chance I’ll eventually end up getting myself the Moritaka as well.) The Zero has the hardest steel of any we’ve looked at so far but it’s not as delicate as you might think; I’ve been cutting through small chicken bones with mine for 5 years.
