Haruyuki makes reliable, affordable blades using super consistent machine forging techniques, combined with a very hands-on process of grinding, sharpening, polishing and handling the blades. The Kokuto is a sturdy option, a little more rugged than your average handmade knife, yet mind-blowingly thanks to Ginsan stainless steel which behaves a lot like traditional carbon steel, but doesn't rust.<\/p>","review":true,"fun-fact-heading":"","fun-fact":""}},"template--15962749042862__dab64165-db66-4e0d-a2f5-8dd52bbf611a-1669404136d9ce1bd1-1":{"type":"product","settings":{"featured_product":"fujimoto-nashiji-nakiri-165mm","text":"<p>Fujimoto knives are the best of everything: high-performance, low maintenance, hand made and affordable!

Masashi Yamamoto isn't one of the oldest blacksmiths, but he is one of the smartest, and by far most talented. Masashi-san is incredibly cerebral in his approach to knife making, constantly experimenting and finding ways to make his blades perform better. In this case, the result is this incredible Kuroshu nakiri. As a result of his insane talent and genius, masashi-san is able to get the SLD steel in this knife much harder than it usually gets, meaning it performs like the Blazen Ryu above, way more rugged. Add to that a damascus blade with that burned kurouchi look and a designer handle, and you've got yourself a recipe to take my money.<\/p>","review":true,"fun-fact-heading":"","fun-fact":""}},"6a66a6e1-f21a-4e3e-a58b-196aee924955":{"type":"product","settings":{"featured_product":"haruyuki-shiso-nakiri-165mm","text":"<p>Hands down, this knife is the crowd favourite, among both staff and customers.
