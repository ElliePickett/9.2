Back in Canada in 2007 he began selling them out of a backpack from the back of his bicycle, while working as a chef in Calgary. He considers his chef years as the best education for being an entrepreneur. Being a chef takes long hours, involves hard work, both mentally and physically, and chefs must be able to put out fires, both literal and figurative, with extreme competence. Today, Kent is still just as obsessed with Japanese knives as the day he first held one. <\/p><p>A couple times a year, he travels to Japan to meet with his blacksmith friends and drinks far too much sake. Each visit he learns more about the ancient art of knife-making. Through this obsession Knifewear has expanded to include five Knifewear stores in Calgary, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Edmonton. Plans are also underway to open a store in Kyoto, Japan. He refuses to confess how many Japanese knives he owns … but he admits the number is rather high. Follow Kevin on Twitter at @knifenerd and find out more about the stores at knifewear.com, and if you meet him in person, ask him to tell you his Lou Reed story.<\/p>","button_label":"Follow Kevin on Instagram","button_link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/knife.nerd\/","align_text":"left","border_style":"none"}}},"block_order":["template--16006506676398__37feeab7-2947-43e4-a459-d1e7faabd087-1675459436a3b63ed0-0","template--16006506676398__37feeab7-2947-43e4-a459-d1e7faabd087-1675459436a3b63ed0-1"],"settings":{"title":"","css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"47244e5d-2098-4a21-b844-b9022616a243":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Kevin's Favourites","collection_description":true,"collection":"staff-collections-kevin-grouped-collection","collection_style":"grid","products_per":4,"products_limit":9,"css_class":"","custom_css":""}},"8cdff70c-3cda-4dea-8d47-193ef399f1a1":{"type":"text-columns-with-images-two-fifths","blocks":{"template--16006506676398__8cdff70c-3cda-4dea-8d47-193ef399f1a1-1674591601fd40faac-0":{"type":"text_block","settings":{"enable_image":true,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/naoto_possible_1_of_1_-3.jpg","title":"","heading_size":"regular_text","text":"","button_label":"","button_link":"","align_text":"left","border_style":"none"}},"template--16006506676398__8cdff70c-3cda-4dea-8d47-193ef399f1a1-1674591601fd40faac-1":{"type":"text_block","settings":{"enable_image":false,"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/naoto_possible_1_of_1_-3.jpg","title":"Naoto Fujimoto","heading_size":"regular_text","text":"<p>Naoto came to Canada several years ago and we aren't letting him go back.
